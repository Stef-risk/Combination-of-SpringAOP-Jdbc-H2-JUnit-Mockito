- Used Spring AOP,Spring JDBC, JUnit & Mockito ,H2
- Simple implementations of some sorting algorithms and searching algorithms 
- Used Spring JDBC to fetch data from table person in the in memory H2 database
- Set up a few JUnit tests for sorting and searching algorithms
- Used Spring AOP to intercept business layer methods' execution and calculate the method's run time
- More features to add :  more algorithms and data structures and also some more tables
